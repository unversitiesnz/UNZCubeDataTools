### man 
Documentation (currently for a single function)

### DESCRIPTION 
Package metadata

### cubehelpers.RData 
Contains a table of descriptions of the variables (e.g., what it means for an individual to be ‘Overseas’)

### datacube.RData 
Contains datacube.v2, the summary data by group being fed into the graphs for this tool

### shinyappload.R 
Runs the following codes, all contained within the folder R:

#### a.	option setup.R 
Creates lists of codings for each possible value of each variable. E.g. for youngGradOptions, Combined = -1, Young Graduate = 1, and Mature Graduate = 0

#### b.	data setup.R 
Does some tidying and descriptions around variable names

#### c.	cube data functions.R
First creates a series of functions (getCube….select()), two for domestic students and two for international students, that take an indicator.data and optionSet argument and return a logical value. It checks whether the selected variable option (sex, ethnicity, etc.) is in the selected dataset.

### Tests	
Performs tests to ensure functions work as expected


## Explanation of variable
A common variable that is passed to functions is `optionSet`. The meaning of this is as follows:  

A list/vector with the following fields: list(dom = bool, sex = int, eth = int, studyLevel = int, subsector = string, fieldOfStudy = int, cohort = int, indicator = string).
